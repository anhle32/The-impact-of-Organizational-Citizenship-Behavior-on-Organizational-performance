# The impact of Organizational Citizenship Behavior on Organizational performance of Vietnamese universities during the COVID-19 pandemic: the moderating role of Transformational Leadership
The studyâ€™s objective was to examine the moderating role of transformational leadership style on the impact of organizational citizenship behavior on organizational performance (case study in Vietnamese universities). By using Bayesian exploratory factor analysis and Bayesian regression analysis, the results showed that organizational citizenship behavior has a positive impact on organizational performance at Vietnamese universities. We found evidence that transformational leadership styles increase the positive impact of organizational citizenship behavior on organizational performance in Vietnamese universities. Based on the findings, we propose implications for Vietnamese universities to influence organizational citizenship behavior and transformative leadership styles to increase organizational performance. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is a rare study that applies Bayesian analysis in this area of research.
